IoT project for Microsoft Student Accelerator Program 2020

The python script in this repository simulates an IoT device that makes measurement of the sun intensity and the soil density. The system is a prototype for an IoT device that helps household gardeners track their veggie patch's suitability to grow crops.

The data from the simulated device is sent to Azure IoT Hub through which it connects to Azure Stream Analytics and ultimately used in power BI to create useful visuals.

Technology used:
- Python version 3.7
- Azure IoT Hub library
- Azure cloud service (specifically Azure IoT Hub and Azure Stream Analytics)
- Power BI
